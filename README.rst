The OAI Harvest module handles metadata gathering between OAI-PMH v.2.0
compliant repositories.

* Free software: GPLv2 license
* Documentation: https://invenio-oaiharvester.readthedocs.org.

Features
========

Metadata exchange is performed on top of the OAI-PMH, the Open Archives
Initiativeâ€™s Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.  The OAI Harvest Admin
Interface can be used to set up a database of OAI sources and open your
repository for OAI harvesting.
